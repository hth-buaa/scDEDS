Description: Implements the scDEDS algorithm, a novel method for predicting Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) by modeling their discrete evolutionary dynamics along a pseudotemporal trajectory. It is specifically designed for paired single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, leveraging the complementary information to infer dynamic regulatory interactions. This package provides a comprehensive toolkit for reconstructing developmental or disease progression pathways from multi-omics snapshots.
