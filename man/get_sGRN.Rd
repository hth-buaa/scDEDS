\usage{
get_sGRN(
  interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs = interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs,
  interest_cell_type_branch_sGRN = interest_cell_type_branch_sGRN
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs}{The output of function get_sGRN_by_TFBS_pwm_by_JASPAR2024.}

\item{interest_cell_type_branch_sGRN}{The output of function get_branch_sGRN.}
}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a cell type and contains:
\itemize{
\item A data frame representing the consolidated sGRN for the cell type
\item Rows: All target genes (TGs) found across all branches of the cell type
\item Columns: All transcription factors (TFs) found across all branches of the cell type
\item Values: Regulatory strength scores from the complete sGRN (values range 0-1)
\item Matrix is sparse with many zeros indicating no regulatory relationship
}
The consolidation process preserves the original regulatory strength values from the complete sGRN while ensuring all TFs and TGs from all branches are represented.
}
\description{
This function consolidates branch-specific standard gene regulatory networks (sGRNs) into comprehensive cell type-specific sGRNs.
It aggregates information from all branches within each cell type to create unified TF-TG association matrices that represent the complete regulatory landscape for each cell type.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations for each cell type:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies all unique TGs and TFs across all branches of the cell type
\item Creates a unified matrix with dimensions encompassing all identified TGs and TFs
\item Populates the matrix with regulatory strength values from the complete sGRN
\item Sets values to 0 where no regulatory relationship exists in the complete sGRN
\item Returns organized cell type-specific networks for comprehensive analysis
}
}
\note{
Important considerations:
\itemize{
\item This function serves as an aggregation step, creating comprehensive cell type-level networks
\item The output matrices include all regulatory relationships from the complete sGRN
\item Missing values in the complete sGRN are represented as zeros in the output
\item The function does not perform any additional network inference or filtering
\item Output directory structure is maintained for consistency with other functions
}
