\title{Extract Branch-Specific Standard Gene Regulatory Networks (sGRNs)}
\usage{
get_branch_sGRN(
  interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs = interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs,
  interest_cell_type_group = interest_cell_type_group,
  ncores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interest_cell_type_sGRN_all_TGTF_pairs}{The output of function get_sGRN_by_TFBS_pwm_by_JASPAR2024.}

\item{interest_cell_type_group}{The output of function cell_grouping.}

\item{ncores}{See in ?get_interest_cell_type_data.}
}
\value{
A nested list structure where:
\itemize{
\item First level: Named by cell types
\item Second level: For each cell type, a list of branch-specific sGRNs
\item Each branch sGRN is a data frame with:
\itemize{
\item Rows: Target genes (TGs) present in the branch
\item Columns: Transcription factors (TFs) present in the branch
\item Values: Normalized PWM match scores from the complete sGRN
}
}
The branch sGRNs preserve the regulatory strength values from the complete network but are filtered to include only the TFs and TGs that are expressed/active in each branch.
}
\description{
This function extracts branch-specific standard gene regulatory networks (sGRNs) from the complete cell-type-specific sGRNs.
It creates subnetworks for each branch within each cell type by filtering the global TF-TG association matrix to include only the TFs and TGs present in each specific branch.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations for each cell type and branch:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies TFs and TGs present in each branch using grouping information
\item Creates branch-specific subnetwork matrices initialized with zeros
\item Populates the matrices with regulatory strength values from the complete sGRN
\item Returns organized branch-specific networks for downstream analysis
}
}
\note{
Important considerations:
\itemize{
\item This function does not recalculate regulatory strengths but filters existing networks
\item Branch networks may be sparse if few TFs/TGs are shared between branches
\item The function uses parallel processing for efficiency with multiple cell types
\item Output directory structure is maintained for consistency with other functions
}
